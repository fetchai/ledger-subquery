## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2022-07-01

- Inject the types registry into the sandbox (#34)

### Added

## [0.1.0] - 2022-06-27

### Changed
- Messages and events have changed `message.msg.msg` to `message.msg.decodeMsg.msg`. This is due to lazy loading and will mean you don't need to provide chain types for messages you don't care about (#17)

## [0.0.6] - 2022-06-21
### Fixed
- Fix chainTypes not being in deployments

## [0.0.5] - 2022-06-15
