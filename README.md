# Ledger SubQuery

This is the Fetch ledger SubQuery project, an indexer for the Fetch network.


# Developing

## Getting Started

### 1. Ensure submodules are updated

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```shell
yarn

# install submodule dependencies
(cd ./subql && yarn)
```

### 3. Generate types

```shell
yarn codegen
```

### 4. Build

```shell
yarn build

# build submodule
(cd ./subql && yarn build)
```

### 5. Run locally

```shell
yarn start:docker
```

## End-to-end Testing

### 1. Install dependencies

```shell
pipenv install
```

### 2. Run e2e tests

_Note: end-to-end tests will truncate tables in the DB and interact with the configured fetchd node._

#### All tests

```shell
pipenv run python -m unittest discover -s ./tests/e2e
```

#### Specific test module

```shell
pipenv run python -m unittest tests.e2e.entities.<module>
```

_(see: `pipenv run python -m unittest --help` for more)_

## Tracing

The SubQuery node and GraphQL API services have been instrumented using [open telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).
This enables end-to-end tracing support for both services, which covers querying Fetchd RPC to inserting into the DB and then reading from the DB to respond to an end-user GQL query.

To run the tracing stack locally, start the docker composition using the [tracing-compose.yml](./tracing-compose.yml) file:
```bash
docker compose -f ./tracing-compose.yml up -d
```

The tracing composition is notably more substantial than the conventional stack and will take a bit longer to start-up.
Once running, you can point your browser to [localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301) to access the [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) dashboard.

## DB Migrations

This repository uses [graphile-migrate](https://github.com/graphile/migrate) CLI to manage database migrations.

### Install dependencies

Install global npm dependencies:

- [graphile-migrate](https://github.com/graphile/migrate)
- [plv8ify](https://plv8.github.io/)

```bash
npm install -g graphile-migrate plv8ify
```

### Running Migrations

Given that you already have a database with some, potentially outdated, schema, you can catch up to the latest state by running all committed but unapplied migrations:

```bash
graphile-migrate migrate
```

_(see: [graphile-migrate README](https://github.com/graphile/migrate#usage) for more)_

### Creating Migrations

#### New table schemas

When introducing schema change which adds an entity / table, it is currently most convenient to allow the subquery node to initially generate any new tables (including indexes and constraints).
This schema can then be dumped for use in the accompanying migration.

The current schema sql file can be generated from an existing DB schema (optionally, including data) via [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html).
Package scripts are available for dumping the schema only or for dumping the schema plus any data present:
```bash
yarn db:dump:schema
# OR
yarn db:dump:all
```

Additional arguments may be forwarded to the underlying `pg_dump` command by appending `-- <additional args / flags>` when running package scripts (see: [npm-run-script docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-run-script)). For example:

```bash
# Dumps schema only from blocks and messages tables
yarn db:dump:schema -- -t blocks -t messages
```

##### When `pg_dump` is insufficient

In some cases, `pg_dump` may not export a relevant DB object; for example, enums.
In these cases it is necessary to manually extract the relevant data from the DB and incorporate it into the initial_schema.sql file.

In the case of **enums**, the following queries expose the relevant records, the results from which can be re-written as a COPY or INSERT statements into the respective tables from which they came:

```
# List enum types
SELECT oid, typname FROM pg_type WHERE typcategory = 'E';

# List values for a particular enum
SELECT * from pg_enum where enumtypid = <pg_type.oid>;
```

#### TypeScript migration

It is not necessary to add any TypeScript source as part of any migration (e.g. 000002).
In the event that the migration is too complex to be easily reasoned about it in SQL, it may be more straightforward to use the plv8ify workflow:

1. Write a migration in ./migrations/current.ts which exports a single function that kicks off the migration (see: [plv8 docs > built-ins](https://plv8.github.io/#plv8-built-ins)).
2. Transform the current typescript migration function to a .sql function:
    ```
    yarn plv8ify
    ```
   
   **This writes the generated SQL to ./migrations/current.sql.**
3. Since we're using a non-default schema name, it's prudent to prepend the following preamble to current.sql:
    ```
    CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app;
    SET SCHEMA 'app';
    ```
4. Lastly, in order for the migration function to execute when the migration is applied, append the following to current.sql (substituting labels identified by surrounding brackets with their respective values):
    ```
    SELECT * from <migration function>([arg, ...]);
    ```
   
### Committing Migrations

Once you're ready to test / apply the migration:
```bash
graphile-migrate commit
```

If it was successful, graphile-migrate will have moved the contents of current.sql (and reset it) into a file named by the next number in the migration count sequence.

_(see: [graphile-migrate README](https://github.com/graphile/migrate#usage) for more)_

### Cleanup

If the plv8ify workflow was used, until it is automated, it is conventional to manually move the contents of the current.ts file into a file in migrations/src named after its respective generated SQL file.
**It is against convention to update any import paths as a result of this move.**

##### Debugging

When things aren't going perfectly, [`plv8.elog`](https://plv8.github.io/#plv8-built-ins) is extremely useful for getting more detail out of the running migration.
Be sure to be looking at the **postgres service's logs** (as opposed to the error message returned by `graphile-migrate`):

```bash
docker compose logs -f postgres
```
